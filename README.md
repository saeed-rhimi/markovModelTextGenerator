# Markov Model Text Generator

## Introduction
This project is a text generator using Markov models. It is developed in Python and utilizes numpy for efficient computations. The generator creates sentences based on input text, modeling the probabilities of word sequences.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Numpy
- String module

## Installation
To set up your environment for running this project, you need to have Python installed. Additionally, install numpy using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Code Structure
- Import libraries: numpy for numerical operations and string for text processing.
- Set the random seed for reproducibility.
- Initialize dictionaries for initial words, first-order, and second-order transitions.
- Define functions:
    - `remove_punctuation`: Removes punctuation from a string.
    - `add2dict`: Adds a key and value to a dictionary.
    - `list2probabilitydict`: Converts a list to a probability distribution.
    - `sample_word`: Samples a word based on its probability distribution.
    - `generate`: Generates sentences using the Markov model.

## Usage
To use this text generator, run the `generate` function after setting up the dictionaries with your input text. The function will output sentences based on the Markov model.

## Examples
Output from the `generate` function will vary based on the input text provided to the model. Here's an example of generated text:
```
i went to bed alone and left me
might just as empty
but it isnt as if and thats not all the money goes so fast
you couldnt call it living for it aint
```
